 Bank App â€“ Simple Instructions
===============================

1. Open a terminal and go to your project folder (where the `src` folder is located).

2. Then run:

   cd src\main\java

3. Compile the classes:

   javac org\example\*.java

4. Start the server:

   java org.example.BankServer

   âž¤ You will be asked to enter a port number (e.g., 12345).
   (Leave this terminal open after the server starts.)

5. In a new terminal window:

   cd src\main\java
   java org.example.BankClient

   âž¤ You will be asked to enter the server address (e.g., localhost) and the same port number used when starting the server.

6. Try the following commands in the client terminal:

   REGISTER|john|1234
   LOGIN|john|1234
   DEPOSIT|john|1234|100
   WITHDRAW|john|1234|50
   BALANCE|john|1234

   Optional invalid command:
   HELLO|test

----------------------------------
ðŸ’¡ Notes:
----------------------------------
- Always start the server before the client.
- Make sure to stay in the `src\main\java` directory while running commands.
- The port must match between server and client.
- All data is stored in memory and will be lost when the server stops.
